### Lucene 8.5.0 Release Highlights:

 * XYPointField allows you to index points in flat X,Y space and efficiently find documents that fall within a bounding box, distance or arbitrary polygon
 * New query builders on LatLonShape allow you to efficiently find documents with a specific relation to a point or polygon
 * You can now store up to 16 data dimensions in a Point field
 * KoreanTokenizer supports custom dictionaries
 * Binary doc values are now compressed, and term dictionaries have improved compression
 * Index flushes are up to 20% faster if all docvalues updates are updating a single field to the same value
 * The index of stored fields and term vectors is now stored off-heap
 * Query parsers based on QueryBuilder can boost particular terms or synonyms by setting BoostAttribute values on a token stream
 * Intervals queries correctly handle repeated subterms in ordered and unordered sources
