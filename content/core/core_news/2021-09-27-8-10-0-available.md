Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:

### Lucene 8.10.0 Release Highlights:

#### New features
- Multi-valued fields are now supported in numeric range facet counting
- Added new analyzer for Telugu
- Near-real-time readers opened from an IndexCommit can now sort their leaves
- SimpleText codec now implements skipping for its postings lists

#### Optimizations
- Performance improvements for faceting, including a new protected API to control which fields are counted for drill-down during drill sideways, and optimized drill sideways iterating
- RegexpQuery's detection of adversarial (ReDoS) regular expressions is improved, catching exotic cases that it missed before, and throwing TooComplexToDeterminizeException
- Speedup for computing the leading prefix and trailing suffix from an Automaton, and for managing powersets during determinize
- Speedups for stored fields retrieval with the default codec (BEST_SPEED)
- IndexWriter uses less RAM when buffering documents, especially in the case of many unique fields
- forceMerge will now merge any number of segments at once, making it much faster in many cases
- Compression improvements for docvalues storage
