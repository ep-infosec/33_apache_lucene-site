### Lucene 8.9.0 Release Highlights:

 * Compression was added to SortedSet DocValues, which allowed to significantly reduce their size on disk.
 * BM25FQuery was extended to handle similarities beyond BM25Similarity. It was renamed to CombinedFieldQuery to reflect its more general scope.
 * A new PatternTypingFilter was added to allow setting a type attribute on tokens based on a configured set of regular expressions.
 * An option was added to supply a custom leaf sorter for IndexWriter and DirectoryReader, which allows to speed up sort queries with a provided sort criteria.
