The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 9.1.0.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires structured search, full-text search, faceting, nearest-neighbor search across high-dimensionality vectors, spell correction or query suggestions.

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:

  <https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>

### Lucene 9.1.0 Release Highlights:

#### New features

 - Lucene JARs are now proper Java modules, with module descriptors and dependency information
 - Support for filtering in nearest-neighbor vector search
 - Support for intervals queries in the standard query syntax
 - A new token filter SpanishPluralStemFilter for precise stemming of Spanish plurals

#### Optimizations

 - Up to 30% improvement in index throughput for high-dimensional vectors 
 - Up to 10% faster nearest neighbor searches on high-dimensional vectors
 - Faster execution of "count" searches across different query types
 - Faster counting for taxonomy facets
 - Several other search speed-ups, including improvements to PointRangeQuery, MultiRangeQuery, and CoveringRangeQuery

#### Other

 - The test framework is now a module, so all classes have been moved from to org.apache.lucene.tests.* to avoid package name conflicts
 - Lucene now faithfully implements the HNSW algorithm for nearest neighbor search by supporting multiple graph layers

… plus a number of helpful bug fixes!
