The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Lucene 8.3.0.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross

This release contains numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements, some of which are highlighted below. The release is available for immediate download at:

### Lucene 8.3.0 Release Highlights:

  * New SpanishMinimalStemFilter
  * New "export all terms and doc freqs" feature to Luke with delimiters
  * Composite Matches from multiple subqueries now allow access to their submatches, and a new NamedMatches API allows marking of subqueries and a simple way to find which subqueries have matched on a given
  * Range Query For Multiple Connected Ranges
  * LatLonDocValuesPointInPolygonQuery for LatLonDocValuesField
  * New UniformSplitPostingsFormat (name "UniformSplit") primarily benefiting in simplicity and extensibility
  * New STUniformSplitPostingsFormat (name "SharedTermsUniformSplit") that shares a single internal term dictionary across fields
  * DisjunctionMaxQuery more efficiently leverages impacts to skip non-competitive hits
  * BooleanQuery with no scoring clause can now early terminate the query when the total hits is not requested
  * Matches on wildcard queries will defer building their full disjunction until a MatchesIterator is pulled
  * spatial-extras quad and packed quad prefix trees now index points faster
  * Add additional leaf node level optimizations in LatLonShapeBoundingBoxQuery
  * Improve performance of WITHIN and DISJOINT queries for Shape queries by doing just one pass whenever possible
  * Introduce shared count based early termination across multiple slices
  * Blocktree's seekExact now short-circuits false if the term isn't in the min-max range of the segment. Large perf gain for ID/time like data when populated sequentially
  * Show SPI names instead of class names in Luke Analysis tab
  * GraphTokenStreamFiniteStrings preserves all Token attributes through its finite strings TokenStreams
  * Introduced SpanPositionRange into XML Query Parser
  * Use a sort key instead of true distance in NearestNeighbor
  * Tessellator labels the edges of the generated triangles whether they belong to the original polygon
  * Use exact distance between point and bounding rectangle in FloatPointNearestNeighbor
  * The Korean analyzer now splits tokens on boundaries between digits and alphabetic characters
  * MoreLikeThis is biased for uncommon fields
