The Open Relevance Project (ORP) was a small Apache
Lucene™ sub-project
aimed at making materials for doing relevance testing for Information Retrieval (IR),
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) into open source.

Our initial focus was on creating collections, judgments, queries and tools for the
Lucene ecosystem of projects (Lucene Java, Solr™, Nutch™, Mahout™, etc.)
that can be used to judge relevance in a free, repeatable manner.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">The Apache Lucene Project Management Committee decided in a vote,
that the Apache Lucene sub-project "Open Relevance" will be discontinued.</span>
