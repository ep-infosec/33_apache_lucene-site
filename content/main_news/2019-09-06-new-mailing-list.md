Title: New mailing lists

The Lucene project has added two new announce mailing lists, `issues@lucene.apache.org` and `builds@lucene.apache.org`.
High-volume automated emails from our bug tracker, JIRA and GitHub will be moved from the `dev@` list to `issues@` and
automated emails from our Jenkins CI build servers will be moved from the `dev@` list to `builds@`.

This is an effort to reduce the sometimes overwhelming email volume on our main development mailing list and thus make it
easier for the community to follow important discussions by humans on the `dev@lucene.apache.org` list.

Everyone who wants to continue receiving these automated emails should sign up for one or both of the two new lists.
Sign-up instructions can be found on the [Lucene-java](https://lucene.apache.org/core/discussion.html)
and [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/community.html#mailing-lists-irc) web sites.
